Compose in a tab
================

This extension is a Mozilla Messaging experiment whose broad goal is to update
the whole composition process. This includes:

* rewriting (most parts of) nsMsgCompose.cpp in JS,
* integrating an external composition UI (e.g. CKEditor),
* add bonus features, like compose in a tab.

This is a proof-of-concept, so we do not expect you to use this for real. See
the [companion blog post] [labs] for more details. Feedback and updates are
welcome on [Google Groups] [groups].
